 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in C++ by implementing a real-world inspired billing system.

The system allows:
- Adding multiple products
- Storing item name, quantity, and price
- Displaying stored items
- Calculating total bill amount
- Exiting safely using menu options

⚙️ How It Works

1. The program runs in a continuous loop.
2. User selects an option from the menu.
3. Based on input:
   - Items are stored in arrays.
   - Data is displayed.
   - Total bill is calculated.
4. The system exits when selected.
